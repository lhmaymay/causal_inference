The term "novelty effect" is usually used to describe a positive effect that is entirely due to fact that there is a change, a new design feature, module, or process being introduced, regardless of what the change is. A novelty effect wears off in time and is thus considered "illusory", meaning that it would be wrong to ascribe the effect to the change itself and to expect that it will continue to persist after the novelty effect wears off. Novelty effects can be considered a case of learning effects and are a major treat to the external validity (generalizability) of online controlled experiments.
